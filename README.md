# CS4215 Project : Gradual Typing

## Usage:
 - You need to have Python 3+ (tested on python 3.8.7)
 - The project depends on the [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn0) module, which is included as a subdirectory in this repo. In case of any issues relating to the module dependencies refer to the module documentation (although there shouldn't be any issues).
 - Write the program in a `.txt` file (or it can be any other extension as well)
 - Run `python main.py <program_file>.txt`
 - There is no input supported by the language. The output / errors will be printed to stdout. 

## Examples:
 - The files in `/tests` demonstrate the key features of the language. There are comments in there to describe what each program is supposed to do. Some programs intentionally throw exceptions to demonstrate the type checker.
